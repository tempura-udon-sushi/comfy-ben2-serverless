## Configuration

### For Minne App (Recommended Settings)

**Content Safety Checker:**
- `strict_mode`: `True` (blocks all inappropriate content)

**Dynamic Prompt Builder:**
- Default template works well for most products
- Customize for specific use cases if needed

### Customizing Product Categories

Edit `nodes.py` line 33 to add/remove product types:
```python
products = [
    'your_custom_product',
    # ... existing categories
]
```

### Customizing Safety Keywords

Edit `safety_checker.py` line 30 to modify unsafe keywords:
```python
def get_unsafe_keywords(self):
    return {
        'your_category': ['keyword1', 'keyword2'],
        # ... existing categories
    }
```
